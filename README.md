# LanguageLearningChatBox

## Scope 
The scope of the language learning chatbot for Italian would be to provide vocabulary practice exercises to users. The chatbot will present Italian words or phrases and ask users to provide translations or definitions in their native language (EN). The focus will be on building users' vocabulary and improving their understanding of Italian words and their meanings.

## Key Features
1. Vocabulary Exercises: The chatbot will present Italian words or phrases and ask users to provide their translations or definitions.
2. Feedback and Evaluation: The chatbot will provide feedback on the user's responses, indicating whether they are correct or incorrect.
3. Randomization: The chatbot will randomize the selection of vocabulary items for each exercise to provide variety and prevent predictability.
4. Difficulty Levels: The chatbot can offer different difficulty levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced) to cater to users with varying language proficiency.***
5. Progress Tracking: The chatbot can keep track of the user's progress, such as the number of exercises completed and their success rate.***

## User Interface
The user interface of the chatbot will be a text-based interface where users can interact by typing their responses. It can be a console or a web-based interface. 

## Interaction flow
“ The interaction flow refers to the sequence and structure of interactions between the user and the system.”

1. The chatbot starts by greeting the user and providing a brief introduction to the Italian Vocabulary Chatbot.

### How to Start/Exit Chatbox:
2. The chatbot prompts the user to enter 'start' to begin the exercise or 'quit' to exit.

### How Language Learning interaction works:
3. If the user enters 'start', the chatbot presents the first word or phrase in Italian along with a textbox for the user to provide the translation.
4. The user enters their translation in the textbox.
5. The chatbot evaluates the user's response and provides feedback, indicating whether the translation is correct or incorrect. It may also provide the correct translation if the user's response is incorrect.

### How to create re-iteration
6. The chatbot prompts the user to enter 'next' for the next word or 'quit' to exit.
7. If the user enters 'next', the chatbot presents the next word or phrase for translation.
8. Steps 4-7 are repeated until the user chooses to exit by entering 'quit'.

### Exit Message
